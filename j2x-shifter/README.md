# J2X-Shifter
Does what it says on the tin


It's a fairly minimal JSON to XML format shifter. 
The idea was making it lightweight and somewhat secure. 


This version of the shifter is barebones to facilitate
building from. 


Operationally, the script takes in a request with the
application/json content type and returns an XML translated
response.
