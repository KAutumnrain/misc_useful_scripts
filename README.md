# misc_useful_scripts
Miscellaneous niche scripts I've written to get miscellaneous niche things done.


Notes:
- Each script has its own readme and requirements
- Most of these are projects for building on since I like keeping scaffolds around to make prototyping faster
- If the readmes are unclear, please ask questions. I'll try to clarify and improve the docs based on that.
